History

This is a set of scripts based on the initial work done by Gabriel Ferreira
posted in his web page at:

para-configurar-un-sistema-realtime-en-audio/


Introduction

The idea here is to have a set of scripts that each one performs some 
system configurations in order to make the whole debian-base system
a real-time one.
